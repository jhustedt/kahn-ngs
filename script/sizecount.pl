=head1 NAME

  sizecount.pl - A writeall script to sort sequences by index and infer the
    sizes of the template DNA.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  This script only has a few useful options:
 --index  : The file defining the search strings and output files.
 --input  : Either a filename or directory containing the (relatively) raw
    fastq data.
 --outdir : Output directory, composed of two csv files, an output fastq file,
    and a summary file.
 --outfastq : Output fastq file, by default this is placed into the output
    directory. File extension not necessary.
 --substitution : String::Approx (Levenshtein) substitution distance, default is 0 (perfect match)
 --insertion: Levenshtein insertion distance
 --deletion: Levenshtein deletion distance
 --spacer : specify spacer length (default 72)
 --debug  : Print a bunch of debugging output?

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  This was originally a demultiplexer for TNSeq data, which has a very specific and
  illumina-incompatible (bcl2fastq) format.  It was slightly reformatted to match
  the following query:

  1. The primary goal is to observe how many of every size DNA template was incorporated into
     a sequencing library.  The implicit inference: when (DNA-size % ~10), the energetic
     requirements for a DNA to loop back on itself decrease, increasing the likelihood that
     the molecule can cyclize and therefore end up in the sequencing library.  Ergo, more
     counts of a particular size is inversely related to the energy requirement.
  2. The input molecules were designed so that each size is distinguishable by its sequence.
  3. Four indices are used to distinguish molecule size (ranging 119-219 bp)
  4. The important caveat: inter-molecular ligation is in a fight with intra-molecular ligation.
     a. Ergo, we need to be aware of multiple indices for two reasons; first to tell the size
        range, second because we need to be able to observe when size-a linearly ligates
        to size-b and when size-a bimolecularly cyclizes with size-b.

  Thus the original implementation is useful but not ideal and has been changed to do the
  following:

  1. Rather than just dump the sequences into separate files, use the comment field
     to print the observed matches.
  2. When it does decide to write output files, it should have some logic to know the range(s)
     as well as the specific size(s) observed. The index file has been rewriten to include all
     relevant information within a single index file (for each diferent index type).
  3. Output a text file describing the number of observations of each-sized molecule that is
     cyclized or not cyclized, when observed with the appropriate number of hits for a single
     cycliztion event.
  4. Output individual CSV files for each cyclization state.

 Updates for 2018-11-13
 1) Verify that a sequence with three hits has the appropriate matching index before and after
    the cyclization site (this will tell us that it was likely unimolecular).
    a. added index sequences to allow for (1) via "stepsynth" and "stepcyc" implementation
    b. add logic to check by looking at index numbers for stepsynth and stepcyc & verifying match
 2) If a molecule is not unimolecular (as above) it is sorted into a bimolecular instead
    a. done for 4 hit, needs to be done for 6 hit still
    a. Does it matter that size-a ligated to size-b, or just that a molecule of each size
       participated in a bimolecular reaction?

 Updates for 2018-11-28
 1) Implemented amatch instead of direct string match for indices.
 2) the index number associated with stepsynth & stepcyc is now capable of being called upon to reference
    itself later for a logic check verifying they are the same index value.
    a. logic check separating unimolecular (matching) and bimolecular (not matching) stepsynth & stepcyc

 Updates for 2018-11-29
 1) fixed incorrect output sizes
 2) altered String::Approx to function as aindex() if params set and as index() if no params set
    a) this somewhat functions for aindex() but does NOT function for index()
        -aindex() no longer allows for unwanted insertions or deletions, but is not finding every match
         that it should

 updates for 2018-12-02
 1) aindex still is not finding what I would expect, but index is better
 2) I have added counters for six hit bimolecular cyclization & two hit bimolecular cyclization.
    a) I don't do anything with these other than count their existence.
 3) I have added counters for excess hits and how many times they end up found.

 Updates for 2018-12-04
 1) added logic for six hit bimolecular and two hit bimolecular
    a) added logs for six hit and two hit bimolecular
 2) separated logs for bimolecular products - 2 hit, 4 hit, and 6 hit are reported in separate csv files

 Needed to be fixed:
 1) fix aindex to find all direct matches and those with a single substitution
 2) Separate out hits based not only on size (already done) and cyclization status (already
 done) but which molecule they came from. Ideally something like:
  47-30-10,165,2000
 -Where the components say that the three index sizes obtained (47, 30, and 10) built a molecule
 of size 165, and it was found 2000 times. Currently this is ignored and the count is solely
 based on size, such that 47-30-10, 77-00-10, and 77-10-00 (and all iterations 77-01-09...77-09-01)
 are all included into the count of 165. While it is important that this total size of DNA cyclized
 (or did not cyclize), I cannot currently remove bias from library input if I don't know which of
 the individual molecules contributed to the overall count.
